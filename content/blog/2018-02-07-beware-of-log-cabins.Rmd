# To `glm` or not to `glm`?

log transforming says that 

$$log(x) \sim N(\mu, \sigma) $$

in other words, this is estimating the mean of log(x)

A GLM is saying that x ~ 

in the glm case, you are estimating the log of the expected value of y

so you're saying that y itself is normally distributed, and $\mu$ log(mu) = a + b etc. 

Meaning, mu is linear through the log link. 

What about gamma?

Height might be a good one for the glm method? Has to be positive, but you would certainly imagine that factors related to height would be multiplicative in nature, e.g. genetics + nutrition
