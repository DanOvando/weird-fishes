# Research

I develop data-driven tools and ideas to help manage marine resources. My current projects include using the behavior of fishermen to predict the abundance of fish, estimating the conservation impacts of a network of marine protected areas, and integrating economic information into data-limited stock assessments. When I'm not doing that, I'm trying to figure out why the parking lot near my building is so crowded on random days... 
I received a B.S from the University of Miami, my Masters in Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara, where I'm currently pursing my PhD as well.
