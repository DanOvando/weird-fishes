  abstract = {Recent reports suggest that many well-assessed fisheries in developed countries are moving toward sustainability. We examined whether the same conclusion holds for fisheries lacking formal assessment, which comprise $>$80\% of global catch. We developed a method using species' life-history, catch, and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64\% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56\%) and fishery yields (8 to 40\%).},

Efforts to mitigate these challenges have led to an extensive literature on fishery performance under alternative management practices, but relatively little evidence exists on the factors that drive the adoption of these management approaches. In this study, a database describing 67 fishery cooperatives around the world is analyzed to help fill this gap. The analysis is focused on two widely implemented catch share management strategies, Territorial Use Rights Fisheries and Individual Quotas. Our empirical approach and interpretation of results are organized according to Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework. Among the evaluated factors, governance aspects appear to be most important to management adoption, specifically the presence of legal conditions on cooperative existence, and the strength of law and stability of governing institutions. It is postulated that the same factors that favor adoption of specific catch share management strategies would also generally play a positive role in their performance. If this is true, our results highlight the importance of considering both sets of factors when trying to spread the implementation of management tools, and show that enabling conditions associated to existing governance structures deserve great emphasis by those who seek to adopt management strategies like catch shares.},

We developed an integrated, size-structured assessment method to estimate trends in fishing mortality, recruitment, and mature biomass. A posterior distribution of spawning potential ratio (SPR) in 2011 was calculated using Bayesian methods and had a median of 44\%, which is higher than most commonly used reference points (e.g. SPR = 40\%). However, there are uncertainties in our estimates and continued monitoring with standardized data collection protocols should be a priority for future work in this fishery. Management should work toward establishing science-based management strategies that consider both the needs of fishing communities and the imperative to conserve unique ecosystems such as the Galapagos Islands.},

  abstract = {Well-managed fisheries support healthy ocean ecosystems, coastal livelihoods and food security for millions of people. However, many communities lack the resources to implement effective fisheries management. No-take marine reserves are a ubiquitous management intervention that provide conservation benefits and under certain circumstances can provide long-term fishery benefits as a result of larval and adult emigration from reserve boundaries. But, support for marine reserves by fishery participants is often limited due to short-term economic impacts resulting from foregone yields. In this study, we examine the timing and magnitude of economic impacts of marine reserves by utilizing a novel metric that discounts future economic benefits of enhanced productivity resulting from reserve protection. We ask under what circumstances long-term benefits outweigh short-term impacts of marine reserve implementation. We simulate fisheries for six species commonly caught in coastal environments and show that while conservation benefits accrue rapidly, more than a decade is often required to provide net fisheries benefits, even under circumstances favourable for reserves. We explore a suite of strategies for mitigating these short-term economic losses, including flexible reserve designs, loans and enhanced ex-vessel revenues. Results indicate that market-based incentives show promise to offset short-term economic losses. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and communicating likely outcomes from marine reserve implementation and the need to engage supply chain actors to incentivize marine conservation that minimizes impacts to fishermen.},

We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous\textemdash{}the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world's fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

We review the available estimates of the status of fish stocks from three sources: the FAO's ``State of Marine Resources'', a database on scientific stock assessments, and recent estimates from statistical models designed to determine the status of unassessed fish stocks. The two key results are (i) that stocks that are scientifically assessed are in better shape and indeed are not typically declining but rebuilding, and (ii) that large stocks appear to be in better shape than small stocks. These results support the view that stocks that are managed are improving, while stocks that are not managed are not. Large stocks receive far more management attention than small stocks in jurisdictions that have active fisheries management systems, and most unassessed stocks are simply not managed. We assert that fisheries management as currently practised can (and often does) lead to sustainable fisheries, and what is needed is to actively manage the unassessed fisheries of the world. More precautionary management is not necessarily needed to ensure the sustainability of managed fisheries.},

  abstract = {Stock status is a key parameter for evaluating the sustainability of fishery resources and developing corresponding management plans. However, the majority of stocks are not assessed, often as a result of insufficient data and a lack of resources needed to execute formal stock assessments. The working group involved in this publication focused on two approaches to estimating fisheries status: one based on single-stock status, and the other based on ecosystem production. For the single-stock status work, a fully factorial simulation testing framework was developed to assess four potential data-limited models. The results suggest that Catch-MSY, a catch-based method, was the best performer, although the different models performed similarly in many cases. Catch-MSY was more effective in estimating status over short time scales and could be particularly applicable for use in developing countries where data time series are often shorter. Harvest dynamics was the most important explanatory variable in determining performance, which emphasizes the importance of having accurate information on fishing effort and total removals. For the ecosystem-level production analysis, the working group used satellite-based estimates of primary productivity by size classes and a more complete food web, which included more complete microbial pathways than earlier approaches. The working group also assembled estimates of ecological transfer efficiencies from a large number of energy flow network models to characterize uncertainty. The first-order estimates of fishery production potential indicated a potential yield of up to 180 million tonnes of fish, which could vary depending on the capacity to sustainably diversify the suite of species that are currently exploited. Planktivorous species provide the largest scope for growth. However, consideration of factors such as the ecological impact on other food web components, profitability of harvest operations, and marketability for these species must first be resolved. The realized production potential for planktivores may be much lower than their potential levels depending on the outcome of these considerations. The working group estimated that up to 50 million tonnes of benthic production could be potentially harvested, although this estimate is subject to similar constraints as those for planktivores. The greatest scope for growth in the benthic component may be found in the mariculture sector, subject to suitable environmental safeguards. Ecosystem exploitation rates should not exceed 20\textendash{}25 percent of available production, considering basic energetic constraints in marine ecosystems. Current harvest levels for benthivorous and piscivorous species (principally fish) exceeded these levels in higher-latitude ecosystems (subarcticboreal and temperate) and were near or slightly below them in lower latitudes and upwelling systems. The estimates of the ratio of current catches to available production for planktivorous species are substantially lower, reflecting the production potential of currently underutilized species. However, targeted harvesting of selected planktivorous species does lead to relatively high exploitation rates for some species. Together, these results provide globally applicable methods for estimating fish stock status and fishery production potential.},

While individual case studies and economic theory suggest that cooperatives may manage fisheries effectively under some conditions, there is little empirical evidence comparing the actions of cooperative fisheries across a diverse set of environments. This study applies a standardized survey method to collect data from a set of cooperatively managed fisheries from around the globe, documenting their social, economic, and ecological settings as well as the cooperative behaviors in which they engage and the role they play in conservation. The resulting database covers 67 cooperatives from the major oceanic regions of the world, providing a unique overview of the global diversity of fishery cooperatives. It enables empirical analysis of the links between the characteristics and contexts of fisheries, such as the development status of the host nation, fisheries management practices, and species characteristics, and the collective actions taken by fishery cooperatives. The evidence shows that cooperatives form in a variety of development and governance contexts, and in diverse kinds of fisheries. Fishery cooperatives often take actions directed toward coordinating harvest activities, adopting and enforcing restrictions on fishing methods and effort, and taking direct conservation actions such as establishment of private marine protected areas.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimates are essential for assessing the viability of populations and the risks posed by alternative management actions. An effort to estimate abundance via a repeated mark-recapture experiment may fail to recapture marked individuals. We devised a method for obtaining lower bounds on abundance in the absence of recaptures for both panmictic and spatially structured populations. The method assumes few enough recaptures were expected to be missed by random chance. The upper Bayesian credible limit on expected recaptures allows probabilistic statements about the minimum number of individuals present in the population. We applied this method to data from a 12-year survey of pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the lower and middle Mississippi River (U.S.A.). None of the 241 individuals marked was recaptured in the survey. After accounting for survival and movement, our model-averaged estimate of the total abundance of pallid sturgeon $\geq$3 years old in the study area had a 1\%, 5\%, or 25\% chance of being $<$4,600, 7,000, or 15,000, respectively. When we assumed fish were distributed in proportion to survey catch per unit effort, the farthest downstream reach in the survey hosted at least 4.5\textendash{}15 fish per river kilometer (rkm), whereas the remainder of the reaches in the lower and middle Mississippi River hosted at least 2.6\textendash{}8.5 fish/rkm for all model variations examined. The lower Mississippi River had an average density of pallid sturgeon $\geq$3 years old of at least 3.0\textendash{}9.8 fish/rkm. The choice of Bayesian prior was the largest source of uncertainty we considered but did not alter the order of magnitude of lower bounds. Nil-recapture estimates of abundance are highly uncertain and require careful communication but can deliver insights from experiments that might otherwise be considered a failure.},

This broader view, along with a process for decision making, can facilitate implementation of EBFM. A pathway to achieve these broadened objectives of EBFM in the United States is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP). The first generation of FEPs was conceived in the late 1990s as voluntary guidance documents that Regional Fishery Management Councils could adopt to develop and guide their ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions, but few of these FEPs took concrete steps to implement EBFM.
